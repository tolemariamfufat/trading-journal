- Today I placed sell order in buy bias and I missed it because I wrongly thought price will pulls back to rebalance FVG of previous day. 
- **Pro Tip:** In USTECH, if a Gap/FVG isn't filled within the first 2 hours of the London session (02:00–04:00), it often becomes a **Breakaway Gap** and won't be filled until the trend completely exhausts—sometimes days later.
- But what i planned was correct it took place after 9:30, I should have been patient.
