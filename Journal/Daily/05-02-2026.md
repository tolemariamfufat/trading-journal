**Trading Journal: Feb 5, 2026** **Topic:** The Importance of Higher Timeframe (HTF) Alignment
**The Lesson:** Always verify the **D1 timeframe** before committing to a lower timeframe (LTF) bias. Today, the 15m candle closed below the Midnight Open (MO), but it was a trap because it ran directly into a "highly protected" D1 institutional support level at **24,981**.

**Key Observations:**
- **The Trap:** Price dipped to 24,892 (below MO), appearing bearish on the LTF.    
- **The Reality:** The D1 level at 24,981 held firm, leading to an aggressive reversal back to 24,980.
- **Correction:** Do not let a 15m "Change in State of Delivery" override a major D1 "Protected Level." The D1 level is the "Boss."
**Action Item:** Check D1 closing prices and HTF rejections _before_ looking for LTF entries during the London Killzone.
## A Support Zone is valid ONLY if:
- It aligns with the **HTF Narrative** (D1/H4).
- It is tested during a **Killzone** (Time).
- It shows **SMT Divergence** with a correlated asset (Confluence).
- It produces a **CISD** on the LTF upon contact (Execution).

### 1. The "Pre-Market Range" Filter
The 9:30 AM open rarely moves into "thin air." It almost always targets a level created between 8:00 AM and 9:29 AM NY (The Pre-Market).
- **The Rule:** Identify the high and low of the 8:30 AM – 9:30 AM window.    
- **The Invalidation:** If the 9:30 AM bell rings and price immediately snaps through the **Pre-Market Low**, your bullish bias is dead instantly. You don't wait for a 15m close. You treat the Pre-Market Low as a **Hard Stop**. 
### 2. The "3-Minute Opening Gap" Filter
At 9:30 AM, look for the first 1-minute or 3-minute gap (FVG).
- **The Filter:** If you are bullish and the 9:30 AM candle leaves a **Bearish FVG** (a gap going down), the market is telling you the HTF narrative is being overridden by immediate sell pressure.    
- **The Action:** You exit or flip bias the moment that Bearish FVG is respected.
### 3. Dealing with the "Fast Speed" (Limit vs. Market)

Because you cannot react as fast as the algorithm at 9:30 AM:
- **Never use Market Orders at the Open.** You will get the worst fill.    
- **Use "Stop-Limit" Orders.** If your invalidation point is 24,924, your stop must be sitting there _before_ the bell rings. If the speed is too fast and it skips your price, that is a "Gap Down"—the ultimate signal that your narrative was wrong.

### Why "Validation" feels impossible at 9:30 AM

The market at 9:30 AM is designed to do one thing: **Create "Inducement."** It will often:
1. Sprint 40 points in your direction (making you feel "right").    
2. Reverse 80 points (invalidating you).    
3. Then finally go in your original direction.    

> **The Filter for this:** **"The 10:00 AM Rule."** ICT often teaches to wait until 10:00 AM NY (the "Judas Swing" of the AM session) to see where the candle bodies actually settle. If you aren't in a trade before 9:30 AM, don't enter until 10:00 AM.
